# Chapter 1: The Anatomy of a Modern JavaScript Application

## ES6 (ES2015)
Changes added:

* Two additional ways to declare variables:
  * `let` - limits the scope of variable to the block
  * `const` - variable which value cannot be changed once it has
  been declared
* Arrow function:
  ```
  const add = (param1, param2) => param1 + param2;
  ```
  * inherits the value of `this` from the context in which they are defined
* [Class](https://www.sitepoint.com/object-oriented-javascript-deep-dive-es6-classes/) - syntax for defining the state and behavior of objects
* [Promise](https://www.sitepoint.com/overview-javascript-promises/) - represents values that donâ€™t exist at the moment of the computation but that may be
available later (asynchronous calls)
